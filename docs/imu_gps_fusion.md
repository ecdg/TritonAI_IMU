# IMU and GPS Sensor Fusion
1. [IMU and GPS sensor fusion using an Extended Kalman filter (EKF)](https://github.com/Triton-AI/DSC190_SP23_Team_EKFIMU) by DSC 190 students from Spring 2023
2. [IMU and GPS sensor fusion without EKF, relying on accurate RTK GPS data](https://github.com/rohanmeserve/DSC190_WI24_Team_1_donkeycar/tree/main) by DSC 190 students from Winter-Spring 2024, see its accurate estimation performance on this [notebook](https://github.com/rohanmeserve/DSC190_WI24_Team_1_donkeycar/blob/main/DonkeyGPS/notebooks/estimator_performance.ipynb)
