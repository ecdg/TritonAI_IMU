## Creating an IMU package (on DonkeyCarâ€”has some overlap with the process of creating an IMU package on ROS2)
write about:

- [ ] explain how to have it running on donkeycar
### A script handling the data from the IMU
The standard DonkeyCar installation includes support for the **MPU-6050** and **MPU-9250** IMU sensors. They have [this script](https://github.com/autorope/donkeycar/blob/main/donkeycar/parts/imu.py) for handling the data from these IMU sensors.

For the **SparkFun 9DoF Razor IMU**, we can use [this script](https://github.com/NikitaB04/razorIMU_9dof/blob/main/imu.py).

For the **BNO086 IMU of the OAK-D Pro camera**, we have this [modified script](https://github.com/rohanmeserve/dsc190_imu_oakd/blob/main/imu_oakd.py) adding support for this specific IMU. These documents [(1)](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/imu/#)[(2)](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/samples/IMU/imu_accelerometer_gyroscope/#imu-accelerometer-gyroscope) were used as a guide by the DSC folks when creating the modified script.

If you are using a different IMU sensor, then look into its support documents for handling its data and whether or not they provide a script that does this. If there is none, then use its documents as a reference as well as other IMU scripts as a guide when creating one.

### To run on DonkeyCar
First, import the IMU script, e.g. imu.py, onto the car folder. Next, modify the complete.py file (it should be in the car folder) so that it imports the IMU object from the script. Then, edit the manage.py file so that it imports from the modified complete.py file, which includes an ``add_imu``.

## Pose estimation using an IMU sensor
Here are pose estimations using an IMU sensor that's been implemented in the Triton AI lab:
1. [IMU & GPS Sensor Fusion]()
2. [IMU Dead Reckoning](https://github.com/ecdg/TritonAI_IMU/blob/main/docs/imu_dead_reckoning.md)
