# To-Do: README
# TritonAI_IMU
## Creating an IMU package (on DonkeyCarâ€”has some overlap with the process of creating an IMU package on ROS2)
write about:
- [ ] imu.py, a script handling the data from an IMU
- [ ] explain the imu.py script being used for different IMU sensors
- [ ] explain how to have it running on donkeycar

### IMU sensors in the lab (make a separate md file for this)

## Pose estimation using an IMU sensor
1. [IMU & GPS Sensor Fusion]()
2. [IMU Dead Reckoning](https://github.com/ecdg/TritonAI_IMU/blob/main/docs/imu_dead_reckoning.md)
